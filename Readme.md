Knowledge Distillation is a procedure for model compression, in which a small (student) model is trained to match a large pre-trained (teacher) model. Knowledge is transferred from the teacher model to the student by minimizing a loss function, aimed at matching softened teacher logits as well as ground-truth labels.

The logits are softened by applying a "temperature" scaling function in the softmax, effectively smoothing out the probability distribution and revealing inter-class relationships learned by the teacher.
